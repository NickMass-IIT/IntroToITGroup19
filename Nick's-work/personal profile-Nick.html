    <li>s3344701</li>
    <li>Email: s3344701@student.rmit.edu.au</li>
    <li>Greek/Australian</li>
    <li>Completed year 12 in 2010</li>
    <li>Can speak English, Greek and Mandarin Chinese</li>
    <li>I enjoy playing video games, watching AFL and professional wrestling, watching/reading anime/manga. 
        I have 1 dog named Harley; he is a Maltese shih-tzu cross.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ever since I was a little kid, I have been interested in video games and computers. I enjoy seeing how things work and how they interact with each other. 
    I currently have a little experience coding or anything software based, but I have built my own computer multiple times.
</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not too sure what my ideal job is currently, I was hoping to get a better understanding or find what I enjoy doing by doing this course. 
    I have found an interest in Artificial Intelligence and wish to explore where that will take me.
